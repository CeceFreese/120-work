Game... rectangle moves back and forth along the bottom of the window and tries to catch ellipses. Uses keyPressed() to move and keeps the same y variable throughout. Ellipses fall from the top of the screen at random x variables between 0 and windowWidth. I will be using an array for the ellipses that utilizes a random x and a random amount of time before they drop from the top of the screen. When one of these ellipses touches the ground it will turn black and stop. The geometric background was created in photoshop and inspired by concept art, specifically some of the concept art for the Pixar films "Monsters Inc." and "The Incredibles".

I plan to code the entire game using ellipses just to work out the problem areas and to understand how everything will work. One problem I know I'll run into is how to control the rectangle "catching" the ellipses. I've been looking around the reference website and found something called keyPressed(). If I cant get that to work the "catcher" will follow the mouse. Since we already used that in other projects I think its a good plan b.
