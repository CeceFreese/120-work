## Week 11


Like always this week starts with reading the class material... and rereading the class material... and triple reading the class material. What a shock! Its like almost everything I thought I knew about coding has been tossed out of the window. Oh well.

This week was all about thinking about pieces of code as objects instead of a set of instructions... at least thats what I got out of it.

For the assignment I used the Marching Dudes example as a starting platform and reworked pieces of code so that it did what I wanted it to do. The most breakthrough worthy thing I changed was a little piece of code to take the ellipses and turn them into regular old circles. This was achieved by stating that this.size_w = this.size_h; Therefore, the computer is coming up with a random number for size_w and equating it to size_h to create a circle. After that it was just figuring out how each piece of original code directly affected the entire sketch and changing or deleting various pieces.

Not the most original project, but I'm still trying to wrap my head around everything. See ya next week.
