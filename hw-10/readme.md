## Week 10

# Overview
3D rings that spin around each other that utilize functions and an array? Why not!

## steps

1. read course material
2. brainstorm
3. interpret
4. get stuck...
5. reread course material
6. get unstuck
7. right "readme" and realize that spelling is not my strongest ability.
8. correct spelin arors in "readme" ;)

One of the links in this weeks course material was to the p5.js reference page. A very useful page. Whats that you see? A section labeled 3D Primitives? Hmmmmmm, what is a torus? Oh my gosh its a beautiful rotating three dimensional ring! Must use.

Basically the rest of the week is spent trying to make tori that spin in a pleasing manner. I wrote two functions, one to draw each set of two tori. To control the spin of these two sets of tori (thats so fun to say) I wrote an array to hold values for the spin of each, these values being 0.01 and -0.01.
