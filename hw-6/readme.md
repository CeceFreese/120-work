# Week 6

## Overview

Evolving art... yes please! This week we built on the ideas of last week while adding new concepts like variables with a random output.

## Steps
Step one: Read the course materials

Step two: Sit in front of a computer and try to figure out what to code.

For this week, my favorite example was the one where an ellipse was drawn with a random diameter. It was soothing to watch and very different from my crazy spinning flower from last week. So, I decided to take the concept of that example and apply it to rectangles. My first problem came with the fact that an ellipse needs three parameters where as a rectangle needs four. But I realized that all I had to do was make two variables generating random numbers; one for the height and one for the width.

Originally this piece had a flashy background that changes colors, but I decided to get rid of it. Those flashing colors took away from nice, calm rectangles. Also, I let the background run for maybe seven minutes and it gave me a headache...

## Conclusions

This week was interesting. I had heard about random number variables before and it was nice to use them in some code. I enjoyed the problem solving that came with applying a concept to a different shape (ellipse to rectangle).
