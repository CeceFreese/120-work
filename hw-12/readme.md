## Week 12

The work for this week was to create a sketch with objects that interact with each other. I'm still trying to wrap my head around everything, so I took an example from the course material and tinkered with it a bit.

### Steps
1. Read the course material
2. Yup, thats pretty much it
3. Simplify code example
4. Try to understand code example

### Problems and Other Stuff
This week was a bit of a struggle just because of the beautiful weather... but thats just an excuse for procrastination. Also, confusion. I decided to take this week to look at a code example and try to break it down and understand it. So, I took the bouncing ball example where the balls change color with each collision. I started by copying the code into atom and then experimenting. Lots of staring blankly at my computer screen. I wanted to focus mostly on the balls' motion, so I got rid of the color changes first thing. Next I was curious about the size of the objects so I tweaked that part of the code to make all the objects the same size. After that it was just looking at the sections for movement and writing this readme.
