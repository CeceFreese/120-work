Cecelia Freese section 50

## Week 5

# Overview
Well, week 5... animation, aka retype pieces of code from the website and then add to it in an attempt to fulfill the homework criteria.

# Process
step one, read the class material

step two, brainstorm

step three, try to accomplish things beyond your means like creating a field of spinning flowers controlled by the mouse... fail... and then cry.

Just kidding, well mostly.

Yes my initial goal was to create a field of beautiful flowers that would spin faster or slower depending on where the mouse was on the canvas. But, that didn't happen. Instead I present to the jury a single, psychedelic flower that spins at different speeds based on where the mouse is.

I looked at the code examples for this week and then manipulated them. The examples that dealt with frame rate and displaying the mouse position.

The first thing I programed was a way to see the pixels that my mouse was on. Last week I struggled with thinking about things on a grid that I could not see. By using the code example to see the pixel coordinates that my mouse was hovering over, programing things like triangles that need various points to define them became easier. Much easier.

So, using the piece of code for the mouse I made the background. Originally, the background was going to change colors... but I couldn't get that to work. And as it was Thursday, I didn't try the class forum. I did try google, but eh, sometimes google isn't as helpful as I'd like to think it is. Oh well.

Now for the actual spinning flower of headaches, I started by looking at the code for the examples having to do with frame rate. I decided to use the code from the third example, and then copy and manipulate it to create the flower. After some troubleshooting and a discovery that yes, semicolons are important, I succeeded in making a flower that spins. Granted, when the mouse is on the left side of the canvas, it doesn't really look like a flower anymore, but it's sort of fun when all those ellipses are spinning super fast when the mouse is on the right side of the canvas.
