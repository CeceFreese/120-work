# WEEK 3 Response

## Overview

 Week three was pretty interesting. It was nice to get into coding things besides text. I liked learning about how to create and manipulate shapes and backgrounds.

## Steps

Well, to complete this assignment I did my usual thing of looking over the information and then implementing it. However, I didn't have as much time this week so I wasn't as thorough as I would have liked. So, after I finish this assignment I'll go back over this week's material to better understand it.

For the "Hello World" project, I played around with the background color and using all caps. So, I made the background color a lovely green CAPITALIZED ALL THE LETTERS BECAUSE CAPITALIZATION IS FUN!!!

## Problems

My only problems came when I skimmed the course material to just finish the assignment instead of reading it thoroughly. Needless to say, thats the last time I do that.
