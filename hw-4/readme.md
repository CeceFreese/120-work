Cecelia Freese section 50

# Week 4

## Overview

Week 4 was all about drawing in p5 and it was more fun than stressful.

## Work

As per the usual, course materials were read and were as informative as always. Moving into the actual assignment was interesting.

The first problem I ran into was deciding what to draw. Sitting down with pencil and paper helped a bit. Finally I decided that something minimalist was the way to go style wise. What can I say? I like simple designs with a few colors.

I had to condition my brain into thinking about things like they were on a grid. That first hour of coding triangles and rectangles was full of expletives and shame. But after my mind was used to drawing things with a set of numbers, the going was much easier. Almost everything in my code is symmetrical, which helped out my brain. It made sketching triangles nice because if I made one and wanted the other to be symmetrical and along side the other, two of my three points had already been defined.

The best part of this assignment (though the entire thing was enjoyable) was choosing color. Color is wonderful.
